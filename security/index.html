<p><a href="https://security.archlinux.org/">https://security.archlinux.org/</a> includes recent CVE&rsquo;s related to official
packages. See <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Security">ArchWiki</a> for general security recommendations.</p>
<p>This post is about practical real-life examples of previous security
vulnerabilities that Linux has been affected with. The CVE&rsquo;s listed in ASA are
of course useful to know about, but I want to see how they can be leveraged by
an attacker. Here are some examples, and what I learned from them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169): your shell is a huge attack vector. Review your zsh plugins, use only trusted plugins, and keep them minimal.</li>
<li>BlueBorne (CVE-2017-1000251, CVE-2017-1000250): start bluetooth service manually, and prefer wired headset, mouse, and keyboard over wireless ones.</li>
<li>Grub2 BootHole (CVE-2020-10713): grub is bloated. Use a minimal bootloaders.</li>
<li>CVE-2021-3156 (Baron Samedit): use doas</li>
<li>Microsoft Follina: PDFs and documents are a big attack vector. While not a Linux-related vulnerability, it reminded me to be cautious with document files. As an alternative, MS office files can be uploaded to Google Drive and viewed there, or using a conversion tool like Pandoc, or soffice. Also PDF viewers can be hardened in settings, or even better, sandboxed (see Zathura seccomp filter).</li>
<li>File previewers: The Follina vulnerability was so terrible that it was executed even without launching office. Simply by having the side preview panel, the previewer executed the vulnerability. If you&rsquo;re using a terminal file manager, then you have to check your <code>scope</code> shell script that previews files. See this Wiki section: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Lf#Sandboxing_previews">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Lf#Sandboxing_previews</a></li>
<li>Archive files: zip bombs</li>
<li>PKGBUILDs: be cautious with random AUR scripts</li>
<li>Malicious USBs: see <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USBGuard">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USBGuard</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I excluded vulnerabilities that are related to servers or hardware like Spectre,
heartbleed and downfall. The solution for these is simply keeping your system
updated, using firewall, sandboxing applications, and the rest of the generic
recommendations.</p>
<h1 id="sandboxing">Sandboxing</h1>

<li><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME/Files#Thumbnails">Nautilus</a> saves thumbnails of all viewed images in <code>~/.cache/thumbnails</code>

<li><code>gvfsd-recent</code> logs file history. See: <code>/home/user/.local/share/RecentDocuments</code>
